		<p>This app was made in Processing and in the Arduino IDE (And can be run in Windows, Mac, and Linux), and uses the NeuroSky MindWave with an Ardunio connected to a pulse sensor. The software detects the user to be asleep using the BPM sensor, and once the user is sleeping, the MindWave begins to detect eye blinking, checking to see if the user has entered REM sleep. Meant to be a visual dreaming / meditation journal with interactivity, its main function is to induce lucid dreams through audio and visual signals (When  the program detects the user to be in REM sleep), but it also functions excellently as a real-time EEG / biometric monitor, as the program records data and organizes it into spreadsheets and images.
		<br>
		<br>
		 I am currently expanding the interface, and incorporating the usage of binaural beats. Also currently refining and testing the device, but right now, in its current state, it plays a musical trigger during REM sleep seemingly highly accurately (Though this claim needs more study and testing).</p>

	<p>The video demonstration above shows the capabilities and features of the program. However, at the time of the video, there were some slight flaws in the program, and so the program had to be reset twice during the night it was running. So in the latter half of the video, when it is showing the user to be in a lucid dream, the interface states that the user is awake and not dreaming, even though he is asleep. This minor issue will be fixed with the next iteration.</p>
